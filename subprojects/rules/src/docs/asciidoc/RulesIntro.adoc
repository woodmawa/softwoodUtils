This project has come of previous work, and a smattering of cross reference from jeasy rules, with the addition of some features
for my lad who was doing a games project and wanted an something for his AI rules engine.

This engine was developed using Groovy v3.0.2 and java 11 LTS

== Where to start
The basic idea is simple, you need a view concepts to work from

. Facts
. Rules and RuleSet
. Conditions
. Actions
. and Effects

and a RuleEngine instance to process the Facts against the Rules

the project consists of a public API folder, and a core folder that provides the implementation
users are expected to use the public API primarily to work with the library.


so taking this in order, here are the basic principles to work with.


=== Logical Model
A picture is worth a thousand words so here is the basic structure of the project
represented in UML.  This shows the core elements of the API and the default implementations
to be found in the src/core folder

== Rules API
=== Facts
Lets start with Facts.  This is implemented as a class in the api folder.

Facts is a named group of individual Fact's that you want the engine to assess against its rules.  This uses a ConcurrentHashMap internally, so
it should be thread safe.

each instance of Facts can have a discrete `name` and `description` if required.  These are optional.

This provides a name, and description attribute, but otherwise the Fact's are store in the ConcurrentHashmap delegate.
Essentially each Map.Entry represents a Fact

Facts provides an << (groovy left shift) operator where by a Map may be passed and this will be put into into the Facts internally.

The RuleEngine can process Facts, or a single Fact if required against Rules.

Facts provides a convenience method `findFact(String key)` that will do a lookup and if the entry is
matched will return the Fact.  If you just want the value rather than the Fact entry use `getFactvalue(String key)` instead

if you want a Stream<Fact> of facts then invoke the `stream()` method, which generates an immutable stream of
facts for a stream pipeline.

=== RuleFactory
In order to simplify and hide the internals a Factory class is provided to generate
instances of the required types, handle defaulting and so forth.

This provides a number of static methods to handle creating key instances of the essential api types you require for rule processing.

The factory allows for (future) alternate implementations of api interfaces, so the full version
uses the appropriate enum `xxxType` as input.  Where only the basic std implementation is to be used
this can be dropped as there is method in the factory that auto applied the correct enum type automatically

e.g.

[source,groovy]
----
Action myAction = RuleFactory.newAction (ActionType.Default, [init map params] {arg -> ...})

is the same as

Action myAction = RuleFactory.newAction ([init map params] {arg -> ...})

----

The Factory has static methods for

. RuleFactory.newCondition (initMap) {closure}
+
 the closing closure is used to set the condition code predicate test

. RuleFactory.newAction (ActionType=null, initMap) {closure}
+
 the closing closure is used to set the action code.  This closure can be passed an argument as input
when invoked from the engine

. RuleFactory.newRule (RuleType=null, initMap) {closure}
+
 the closing closure is used to create a default anonymously named action and attach it to the action property
of the Rule

. RuleFactory.newRuleSet (initMap)
+
 just returns new instance of named RuleSet, where this will be "anonymous RuleSet", if a 'name' is not provided in the
initMap

. RuleFactory.newRuleEngine (RuleEngineType=null, initMap)

uses of this can be seen in the `src/main/groovy/scripts` directory and in the `src/tests/groovy` speck test directories

=== RulesBuilder

In addition to the basic factory capability there is a Rules builder DSL for building rules sets

This is best shown by example, where by you create an instance of the builder, at (1).  With the builder you call the
ruleSet target in the builder and provide it a name (2), followed by a closure to invoke the build targets for
a `preCondition` (3), and `action` (4), and any `effect`s (5).

for any given `rule` the preConditions are optional and do need to be set.  An Rule with no preConditions will just execute its action.

at present an Rule has only a single Action target per rule (this may change in future releases later).

A rule can also have an any number of `effects`, which are just closures that are called post the action if they are provided

the introduction of the optional `effects` for a `rule` was driven by my sons requirement for his AI to change games rule state after
an action had been performed.

The last iteration  (6), just forces the `rule.action` to be performed regardless of any guard preConditions

        preCondition ('isTired', description:'must meet',   <.>
                    lowerLimit:-1, upperLimit:10 ,
                    test:{ fact-> fact.value < 60})
        action ('act#1', description:"do something", stateData:[:],  <.>
                doAction : {println "your tired";'success'})
        effect (action : effectAction )   <.>
    }
    rule (...) {...}
}

rules.each { Rule rule->   <.>
    print "just do the action directly : "
    rule.action.invoke()
}
